People of all ages frequently have orthopedic injuries, which can have a substantial effect on day-to-day activities. A significant degree of patience, dedication, and the right medical treatment are necessary for the recovery from severe injuries, which can be a protracted and difficult process. In this work, we provide a method for estimating the length of time it will take patients with orthopedic injuries to recover. The approach is based on a number of clinical parameters, including age, gender, kind of injury, and other pertinent medical data, and was constructed using machine learning techniques. The suggested approach forecasts how long the orthopedic damage will take to heal using an artificial neural network. The effectiveness of the system is assessed using a dataset of actual patients with orthopedic injuries.
